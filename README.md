#Nameserver

A simple demonstration of Http in Angular 2

###Overview

Illustration of the use of the Angular 2 Http service. A basic HTML table is populated by JSON data 
generated by a simple webserver written in golang. The server provides a JSON array of 
10 randomly generated names, each with additional 'age' and 'id' tags, per GET request.
Within the main angular file 'main.ts', the service 'PeopleSvc' retrieves this data from the the webserver. This service is then
subscribed to by the App, and the data interpolated by its template. 

###Requirements
